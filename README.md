## Building
You'll need JDK 17+ to build this project. Then just run
`gradle assembleDist` to build distributable archives.

## Usage
- Unpack your build archive somewhere.
- Run `bin/qizd-launcher.bat` to open the launcher app.
- Set home path in settings to your directory of choice (preferably in the same directory, where you put the launcher)
- Download JRE 17+ of your choice (I recommend [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)), and unpack it into your chosen home path in a folder `jre/`
- Add your profile
- Download Minecraft and modpack
- Enjoy
